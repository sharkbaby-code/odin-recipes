        <p>This is a foolproof recipe for cooking Jollof rice,
         West Africa&apos;s most popular dish. I like to serve it as a side dish with my West African-style grilled beef, 
        but it can also be a main course.</p>

       <p>Jollof rice is a very tasty and delicious food, with a wonderful aroma and taste if cooked properly (by folowing this recipe).
        Best served for lunch and dinner.</p>

    <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>

    <li>2 tablespoons smoked paprika</li>

<h3><em>Steps</em></h3>

<ol>
    <li>Combine tomato, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, fresno chili, garlic, ginger, and water in a blender for the sauce.
     Blend on high until smooth and set aside.</li>

    <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt and sauté until onion starts to soften, 4 to 5 minutes.
    Clear space in the middle of the pan, add tomato paste, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes.
    Season with paprika, curry powder, cumin, thyme, pepper, and turmeric; continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes 
    until everything is well combined.</li>

    <li>Turn off the heat, and stir in the rice, making sure every grain of rice is coated with the oil-tomato mixture.
    Add bay leaf and chicken bouillon paste.</li>

    <li>Turn heat to high, stir in tomato sauce, and bring to a vigorous simmer. Cover with a tight fitting lid, reduce heat to medium-low,
    and simmer for 20 minutes. Do not remove the lid or stir rice.</li>

    <li>Turn off heat after 20 minutes, and set the timer for 12 minutes. Allow rice to sit and do not remove the lid.</li>

    <li>After the 12 minutes are up, remove lid, and fluff rice with a fork, separating all the grains.
    Serve garnished with green onions and chopped cilantro.</li>
